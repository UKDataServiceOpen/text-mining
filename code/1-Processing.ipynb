The games had a very standard format, with every game ending with either '1-0', '0-1' or '1/2-1/2'. Thus, I was able to use regular expressions (covered in more detail later) to iterate over the file, selecting everyithing until it found an instance of '1-0', '0-1' or '1/2-1/2', at which point it would cut what it had selected, write it to a blank file, save it, and start iterating over the original file again. \n",

    "Lemmatisation is similar to stemming, in that it aims to turn various forms of the same word into a single form. However, lemmatisation is a bit more sophisticated because: \n",
    "- It recognises irregular plurals and returns the correct singular form. Example = 'rocks' --> 'rock' but 'corpora' --> 'corpus' \n",
    "- If part of speech tags are supplied, it treats verbs, adjectives and nouns differenly, even if they have the same surface form. Example - 'caring' would not be changed if used as an adjective (as in 'his caring manner') but would go to 'care' if it was a verb (as in 'he is caring for baby squirrels'. In contrast, stemming would remove the 'ing' and turn 'caring' into 'car'. \n",
    "- If no part of speech tags are supplied, lemmatisation tools tend to assume words as nouns, so the process becomes a sophisticated de-pluraliser. \n",

    "Again, you import a specific tool from nltk, define a short form for its use, apply it to the relevant input variable, saving the output as a new variable with a suitable name. \n",
