    "At the end of the last section, we got held up by the need to do part-of-speech (POS) tagging in order to get a really effective lemmatisation process. POS tagging is actually basic NLP, as opposed to the kind of cleaning and regularising that we were doing in the last section. So why should a NLP process be needed before the preparatory processing is done? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it comes done to choices. Not every analysis will need a sophisticated lemmatiser, so those projects may have a nice finish to the processing step and the start of the extraction or NLP step. Others willneed the lemmatiser or name entity recognisers or other advanced preparatory steps. Those projects will have a less clear distinction between preparation for NLP and NLP. \n",

    "The main takeaway point here is that researchers need to know that developing a text-mining project can be messy, iterative, and complicated.
