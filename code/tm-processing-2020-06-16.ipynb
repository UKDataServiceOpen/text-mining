The games had a very standard format, with every game ending with either '1-0', '0-1' or '1/2-1/2'. Thus, I was able to use regular expressions (covered in more detail later) to iterate over the file, selecting everyithing until it found an instance of '1-0', '0-1' or '1/2-1/2', at which point it would cut what it had selected, write it to a blank file, save it, and start iterating over the original file again. \n",
