# Interactive coding materials

We have developed a number of Jupyter notebooks containing a mix of Python code, narrative and output.

If you would like to run and/or edit the code without installing any software on your machine, click on the button below. This launches a **Binder** service allowing you to interact with the code through your web browser - as it is temporary, you will lose your work when you log out and you will be booted out if you donâ€™t do anything for a long time.

Once Binder has been launched, click on the notebook you want to run. (*Don't worry if takes up to a minute to launch*)

### Launch Text-mining for Social Science Research as a Binder service: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UKDataServiceOpen/text-mining/HEAD)<br>

Alternatively, you can download the notebook files and run them on your own machine. See our guidance on installing Python and Jupyter [here](https://github.com/UKDataServiceOpen/computational-social-science/blob/master/installation.md).


**NOTE: If you encounter any errors when running the code in Binder (or when running this in Jupyter notebooks) please either fork the code and let us know or contact us via: louise.capener@manchester.ac.uk and I'll sort it!**
